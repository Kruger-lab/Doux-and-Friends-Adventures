# Doux-and-Friends-Adventures
I created a python game for my college miniproject using the pygame module. The UI is made using the WxPython as the project description required it.

To run to program:-
pip install the pygame module and run the main.
make sure the assets folder,MAP_json.json,Level Editor.py and SpriteSheet are in the same directory as the main.py file
